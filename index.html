                             become increasingly prevalent due to the rise of social media.
                             The opinions and lifestyles of peers are constantly being shared
                              online which pressures people to adopt the beliefs of others.
                              Sometimes, I change my behavior depending on what environment 
                              I’m in and attempt to fit in with the crowd. I hope that later 
                              in the future I will be able to act the same around everyone and 
                              not follow the collective opinion of others.</p>

                            . I regret doing many of the things that I’ve done and also regret not things that I chose not to do. 
                            I need to work on letting go of what has already happened and focus on living in the present rather than the past.
                             Despite this, I think it’s important that I don’t completely neglect mistakes made previously to prevent making the same mistakes in the future.</p>

                             This mindset is not helpful for personal growth and usually causes unnecessary stress. 
                             Instead, accepting the circumstances of my situation will allow me to focus on factors that 
                             I can control and help make the best of what I have.</p>

                            Usually, I’ll develop a more pessimistic view of life and become much less productive for a period of time
                             before I eventually get over it. Putting a limit on my self-pity can help me develop a mindset where I’m searching for solutions
                              rather than obsessing over problems. I hope that in the future, I will be able to get rid of the negative mindset

                            something amazing. However, it just turned out lackluster and I don’t have many memories from this 
                            current school year. Getting into the cycle of saying “My life will get better after I finish _________” 
                            is unhealthy because we’re always rushing to get to the next task instead of appreciating what we already have.

                            We are always trying to get approval from someone and it’s unhealthy because we’re changing ourselves to impress others.
                             I’ve compared myself with others and tried fitting in with the crowd multiple times but it usually feels wrong and unauthentic. 
                             Seeking validation from others can easily lead to frustration and disappointment because they have different circumstances from you.
